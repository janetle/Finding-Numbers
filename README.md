# GA-project-1
 
My first project, I want to make something simple yet intriguing. This game is model after a childhood game that I used to play with paper and pen. 

The rule is simple. You need to click on the numbers in increasing order. Each time you click correctly, you score 1 point. The numbers from 1 to 100 are randomly distributed to the table cells.

The challenges I faced when writing this game:
	- Automately generate table with given number of rows and pushed it to HTML using DOM manipulation.
	- Create an array of numbers that randomly shuffles everytime the game starts 
	- Making timer bound to start button. This took me quite some time. Previously, my timer always started when the page is loaded.

What I learn from project -1:
 	I enjoyed doing the project and happy with the outcome.
 	Have better understanding about function in JS.
 	Improve my skill with CSS ðŸ˜Š.

What I can do to improve my game:
	The  board can look better.(I'm not that much of an art person after all ðŸ™„). I want the numbers to appear trapped in bubbles that floating around and burst when clicked.

This is how my basic version looks like:
